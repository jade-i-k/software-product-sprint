      I have been intrigued by other languages for as long as I can remember.
      The first time this interest has truly been able to be flourish, however,
      was when I got the opportunity to study Mandarin Chinese at my old high-school,
      the Spence School.
      Ever since then, I have absolutely loved taking the time to study the language
      and Chinese culture in general. 
      <br><br>

      I am still taking Chinese at Columbia but I plan for this to be my last semester of it.
      This is due to the fact that past summer, when everyone was encouraged to stay inside
      and quarantine, I dedicated a lot of my time towards reviewing Chinese
      along with beginning to learn some Japanese on the side.
      Doing so made me realize I've reached a level of proficiency in Mandarin
      where I can focus on self-study and still significantly improve my fluency level.
      I really appreciated the fact I was able to structure what I learned around topics
      I found most relevant to my personal life along with set a more flexible schedule
      that accommodated any unknown difficulties I encountered. 
      <br><br>

      Despite the fact that I won't be continuing to learn Mandarin in a formal setting
      during college, I'll always appreciate the memories I have made with my old teachers
      and classmates. My fondest memory was when I was able to visit China for two weeks
      with other students in my high-school who were all also taking the language.
      I've included some pictures I took below!
